# Summary  
1. the proposed saliency model takes a data-driven strategy for encoding the underlying saliency prior information, and then sets up a multi-task learning scheme for exploring the intrinsic correlations between saliency detection and semantic image segmentation.
(multitask means semantic segmentation + salient object segmentation, sharing conv layers)
2. present a fine-grained super-pixel driven saliency refinement model based on graph Laplacian regularized nonlinear regression with the output of the proposed FCNN model.

## Benifits  
1. produce effective features for object perception.
2. capturing the semantic information onnsalient objects across different levels using the fully convolutional layers
