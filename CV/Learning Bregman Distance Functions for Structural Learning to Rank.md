## Benifits  
1. propose a unified model that jointly performs the task of learning to rank and that of learning Bregman distance functions under the framework of structural SVM
2. develop a robust framework of learning to rank to alleviate the bias of noisily labeled outliers, and formulate the problem of robust structural Bregman distance functions learning to rank as a nested optimization.
