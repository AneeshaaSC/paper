# Summary  
This paper provides a deep netural network model to do automatic photo enhancement.  

## Benifits  
1.  propose a novel online metric-weighted linear representation for visual tracking.
2.  design a time-weighted reservoir sampling method to maintain and update limited-sized sample buffers in the linear representation. 

## Future Improvements  
To balance efficiency and effectiveness, a mixture of nonstructured and structured metric learning methods can be alternatively applied during tracking. (For example, the non-structured method can produce metric learning results with a high update frequency, and then the structured method further generates the refined metric learning results with a low update frequency.)
