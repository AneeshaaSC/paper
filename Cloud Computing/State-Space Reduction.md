# Problem
Aim: calculated as the set difference Lwhole − Lsum  
State space explosion: calculation of Lsum, which requires all possible combinations of system states to be computed. A key observation is that the definition of Lξ = Lwhole − Lsum (and our proposed extension) implies that emergent property states in Lξ are those states that are in Lwhole but not in Lsum.  

# Thoughts of solutions
If states that are in Lwhole but not in Lsum can be identified with confidence as being in Lwhole but not in Lsum without computing Lsum.  

## use the degree of interaction between agents, δ, thus eliminating the unnecessary calculation of Lsum  
* categories:  
the system states of interest can be divided into  
(1) Lξ, due to strong interactions.  
(2) Lo, due to interactions that are not strong. 
Three types of nonstrong interactions: no interaction (individual agent behavior), interaction that has no overall effect on the system, and weak interaction  
* Degree of Interaction Formalism:  
D(S(t), S(0)) = DI(S(t), S(0)) + DN(S(t), S(0)).
